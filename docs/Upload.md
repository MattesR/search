# Upload a collection

Hoover is designed to ingest large collections automatically from a
[Collectible](Collectible.md) source, but it's also possible to upload
documents manually.

1. From the admin pages, in "Collections", click on "Add Collection".

2. Enter a title. The *Name* will be generated for you.

3. In the *Loader* field, select "Upload".

4. In the *Options* field, enter `{"name": "mycol"}` (replacing `mycol` with
   the name generated in step 2).

5. Click on "Save"

6. Back in the collections page, click on the "upload" link, next to the newly
   created collection.

7. Select and upload a zip file containing PDF files.
